# newwin README

This is bunch of files for the extension that allows a new type of (programmable) windows in VScode.
To use it - Right Click and pick "New Window" from the context menu.

After I spent a few hours on vscode extensions (which is windows 3.0 basically) - this will be on hold for a little.
